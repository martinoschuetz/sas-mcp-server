"""SAS Viya compute session and job orchestration.

These helpers drive the Compute service end to end: resolve a compute context,
open a session, submit code, and poll for completion. ``run_one_snippet`` is
the public entry point used by the ``execute_sas_code`` MCP tool.

To avoid paying the (slow) session spin-up cost on every call, compute sessions
are pooled by :class:`_ComputeSessionCache`: one reusable session per
authenticated user and compute context. Because compute sessions are stateful,
SAS WORK tables, macro variables, and assigned librefs persist across calls
until the session is reset (``reset_cached_session``) or reaped by Viya for
inactivity. Generic REST helpers and the shared client/logger live in
:mod:`sas_mcp_server.viya_client`.
