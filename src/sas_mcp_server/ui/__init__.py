"""Interactive views for hosts that render MCP Apps.

Some results read badly as text however well the tool shapes them: a hundred
rows of a table, a SAS log, a form's worth of typed attributes. The MCP Apps
extension (``io.modelcontextprotocol/ui``) lets a tool also carry a small HTML
view that a supporting host — Claude, ChatGPT, Microsoft 365 Copilot, VS Code,
Cursor — renders in a sandboxed iframe beside the result, and that can call
the server's tools itself for the next page, a refresh, or a save.

The views here are **additive**. A tool's return value is exactly what it was;
the view is extra metadata (``_meta.ui.resourceUri``) plus a ``ui://`` resource
holding the HTML. A host without the extension never reads either, so Claude
Code and every other text-only client see nothing different. And every request
a view makes goes through the host to this server as an ordinary ``tools/call``
with the session's token: the browser never talks to Viya, and a tool a
deployment withholds (``MCP_TIERS``, ``MCP_READ_ONLY``) is withheld from the
views too.

Wiring is central, not per tool. :data:`VIEWS` says which tools carry which
view; :func:`app_config` hands the tier recorder the ``app=`` argument for a
tool as it registers, and :func:`register_views` publishes one resource per
registered tool afterwards. The HTML is assembled by :func:`render_view` from
three parts kept as files beside this module: the shell (theme tokens and the
runtime every view shares), the vendored ``@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps``
bridge, and the view itself. Everything is inlined — no CDN, no external
stylesheet — because hosts build the iframe's CSP from what the server
declares and at least one ignores the declaration entirely; inline is the
one form that renders everywhere, including on an air-gapped Viya.
